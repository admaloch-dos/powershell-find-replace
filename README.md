<h2> Introduction:</h2>
This is a simple PowerShell script designed to facilitate mass editing of files on our server by performing find and
replace operations.
<h2> Purpose and Background:</h2>
We often encounter situations where we need to make widespread changes, such as modifying names or email addresses,
across numerous files. To simplify and expedite this process, I have created a PowerShell script that allows for
quick and easy mass editing on the fly.
<h2> How to Use:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Add the script file to the directory where you want to perform the mass editing.</li>
<li> Open the script file and edit the search and change text according to your requirements.</li>
<li> Right-click on the script file and select "Run with PowerShell" to execute the script.</li>
</ul>
